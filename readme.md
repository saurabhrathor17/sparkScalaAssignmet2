- Here is an extract of what the GHTorrent log looks like:

-------------

- Each log line comprises of a standard part (up to .rb:) and an operation-specific part. The standard part fields are
  like so:

- Logging level, one of DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR (separated by ,)

- A timestamp (separated by ,)

- The downloader id, denoting the downloader instance (separated by --)

- The retrieval stage, denoted by the Ruby class name, one of:

event_processing

ght_data_retrieval

api_client

retriever

ghtorrent

Questions:

1. Write a function to load it in an RDD.

2. How many lines does the RDD contain?

3. Count the number of WARNing messages

4. How many repositories where processed in total? Use the api_client lines only.

5. Which client did most HTTP requests?

6. Which client did most FAILED HTTP requests? Use group_by to provide an answer.

7. What is the most active hour of day?

8. What is the most active repository (hint: use messages from the ghtorrent.rb layer only)?
